### Your fee seems expensive. Isn't DIY software cheaper?

*Aria-label: Question about the cost of professional tax services vs. DIY software*

It's true that DIY software has a lower upfront cost. But think of it this way: are you paying for software, or are you investing in a result? Our fee is an investment in maximizing your refund and minimizing your tax liability. We often find missed deductions that put more money back in our clients' pockets than our fee costs. The real question isn't which option is cheaper, but which one provides the best financial outcome and peace of mind.

### My taxes are pretty simple. Do I still need a professional?

*Aria-label: Question about needing a professional for a 'simple' tax situation*

Many people believe their tax situation is 'simple,' but life events like a new job, a side hustle, getting married, or even receiving a small inheritance can introduce surprising complexity. The tax code is full of nuances that software might not prompt you about. Our 'Free Second Look' review often uncovers missed opportunities even on returns that seemed straightforward. It costs you nothing to find out if 'simple' is leaving money on the table.

### How can I be sure my personal and financial data is secure with you?

*Aria-label: Question about data security and privacy*

Trust is the cornerstone of our business. We adhere to the strict data security standards mandated by the IRS for all authorized e-file providers. All your documents are handled through secure, encrypted channels, and our systems are protected with multiple layers of security. We take our responsibility to protect your sensitive information as seriously as we take our responsibility to protect your financial interests.

### What happens if I get audited after you file my taxes?

*Aria-label: Question about audit support and assistance*

This is a common fear, and it's why having a professional on your side is so valuable. While an audit is unlikely, if the IRS does have questions about a return we prepared, we don't disappear. We stand by our work and can provide support and guidance on how to respond to IRS inquiries. This audit assistance is a key part of the peace of mind we offer.

### Is it really worth the effort to amend a past return?

*Aria-label: Question about the value of amending past tax returns*

You'd be surprised. We've recovered thousands of dollars for clients by amending past returns. The IRS gives you a three-year window to claim a refund you're owed. If you've been missing out on deductions or credits, that's three years of money left unclaimed. Our 'Free Second Look' makes it effortless to find out if it's worth your while. We do all the work of reviewing the old returns.

### Why shouldn't I just do my own taxes?

*Aria-label: Question about the risks and benefits of DIY tax filing*

Honestly, you should do your own taxes if you enjoy the process and are confident you can navigate the 100+ pages of the Form 1040 instructions and all the annual changes to tax law. However, if you value your time and want the certainty that you're not overpaying or risking an audit, that's where we come in. We're not just selling a service; we're providing a financial safety net and the assurance that you've achieved the best possible tax outcome.
